# WhereIsIt
Prototype search for products within supermarkets and retail stores

## What is it?
Sometimes you want to find something in a store. You've never been there, or you don't know the layout, or it's small and easily passed over while scanning shelves. You can search for the item with this and it'll give you an aisle, section, and shelf to look on.
